Check Python Interpreter in VS Code
    In the bottom-right corner of your VS Code window, check which Python interpreter is selected.
    Ensure it matches the one where PYGAME is installed. You can verify this by running:
    python -m pip show pygame
To check: 
    From your screenshot, it is clear that pygame is installed under Python version 3.13 (C:\Users\libaw\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13).
    However, the Python interpreter you're using in VS Code might not match this installation.

    In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
    Search for and select Python: Select Interpreter.
    Choose the interpreter path:
    makefile
    C:\Users\libaw\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13...
    Restart VS Code after selecting the correct interpreter.

1) pip install pygame on command prompt
2) python -m pip show pygame
3) ctrl+shift+p -> selected the interpreter based on the python version shown in terminal.
4) restart if required. Then it must work
